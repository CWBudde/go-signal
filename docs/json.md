# JSON output

With `-o json` (or `output: json` in the config file, or `GOSIGNAL_OUTPUT=json`), commands write
JSON to stdout instead of text. Logs and errors still go to stderr, so stdout can be piped into
`jq` or a script. Each command prints one document as a single line.

## Versioning

Every document has a top-level `version` field, currently `1`. It changes only when a field is
removed or changes its meaning. New fields can appear in any release, so scripts should ignore
fields they don't know.

## Conventions

- Field names are camelCase.
- Times are RFC 3339 strings in UTC, e.g. `"2026-09-20T12:30:00Z"`.
- Fields marked _optional_ are left out when the value is unknown; all others are always present.
- Accounts and users are identified by their ACI (a UUID); phone numbers are E.164
  (`+4915112345678`).
